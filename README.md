Download Youtube videos using Python <br>
Using the Pytube library (https://github.com/pytube/pytube) in order to run a short program allowing us to download videos.
YT Regex is often updating and Pytube's own script for downloading video's is often updated (if error when running, check the newest one for potential changes)

### In order to run:
Copy the link of the video/playlist and paste as 'link' when running:

$ pytube link

### Downloads:
Videos will appear in the same folder as the program
